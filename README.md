# Splashscreen

Hi Guys,
 
I bring to you a very basic application DLL.
It is a loading screen for your application.

To Use:
1. Add it as a reference to your project.
2. Make a variable for use. (Splashscreen.Form1 loadform = new Splashscreen.Form1();)
3. Edit the form's text/ progress bar (optional.)
4. Now you must call it to show like this: loadform.ShowDialog(); (If you not use ShowDialog then it will not show the form or it will just load the startup form for your project.)
 
You can use this as long as you leave credit for where it is due.
